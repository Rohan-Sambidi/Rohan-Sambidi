- 🎓 I graduated with a Master's degree in Computer Science from Arizona State University
- 🧑‍💻 I'm actively seeking employment opportunities
- 🔭 I’m currently building an AI agent at [Ascend](https://www.myascend.ai) and engineering the agentic workflow
- 🌱 I’m currently learning AWS, Databricks, and LangGraph
- 💬 Ask me about my projects on jailbreaking LLMs and Neuro-Symbolic AI

I built a solid foundation in computer science principles and I'm ready to apply them in the industry. I belive that the most impactful innovations are born at the intersection of curiosity and collaboration. Whether developing innovative algorithms, optimizing models, or uncovering insights from data, I would love to contribute to projects that push the boundaries of what technology can achieve.  

Beyond technical skills, I bring Integrity, determination, and perseverance—the three qualities that define me. These values drive my collaborative mindset, commitment to continuous learning, and passion for innovation.
